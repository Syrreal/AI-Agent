# **INCREDIBLY UNSECURE**
### **_PROBABLY DONT USE THIS_**

Basic AI agent built as part of the boot.dev course

The only security precaution in place is a restriction on the working directory set by the user in config.py

Built using Google Gemini
Agent only takes an initial prompt and has no capability of further conversation
